### Important Details and Instructions

1. **Ignore Store/Brand Prefix**  
   - Some items have the prefix "**AH**" (Albert Heijn). This prefix should generally be **ignored** when categorizing. Focus on the rest of the product name to determine the correct category.  
   - Example: "AH ELSTAR" → Elstar is an apple variety (fruit), so categorize as **FRUIT**.

2. **Look for Keywords or Partial Matches**  
   - Many Dutch product names may include hints for specific categories. For instance:
     - Words like "kaas," "cheddar," or "feta" usually indicate **CHEESE**.  
     - "Ham," "kip," or "vleeswaren" usually indicate **MEAT**.  
     - "Tonijn," "zalm," or "haring" usually indicate **FISH & SEAFOOD**.  
     - "Brood," "baguette," "pistolet," "wrap," "naan" often fall under **BREAD**.  
     - "Bouillon," "kruidenmix," "specerijen," or "peper" commonly fall under **HERBS & SPICES**.  
     - "Snoep," "chocolade," "gum" often go to **CANDY & CHOCOLATE**.  

3. **Distinguish Similar Categories**  
   - **FRUIT** vs. **VEGETABLES**: Make sure the product is indeed fruit (like apples, bananas, berries) vs. vegetables (like tomatoes, lettuce, peppers).  
   - **BREAD** vs. **PASTRIES**: Croissants, donuts, sweet pastries go under **PASTRIES**; typical breads, rolls, naan, wraps go under **BREAD**.  
   - **DIPS & SAUCES** vs. **CANNED GOODS**: If it’s a sauce or dip (like tomato sauce, mayonnaise, hummus), use **DIPS & SAUCES**. If it’s canned vegetables, beans, or tomatoes, use **CANNED GOODS**.  
   - **FROZEN FOODS** covers all frozen items, including fries, pizza, ice cream, etc.  

4. **If Unsure, Use `OTHER`**  
   - If the product doesn't clearly fit any defined category, or if the product name is very vague (e.g., “KITCHEN GADGET”), categorize it as **OTHER**.

5. **Formatting**  
   - Your output **must** be a valid JSON array of objects.  
   - Each object must have exactly **two** fields: `"product_name"` and `"category"`.  
   - Example output (shortened for brevity):  
     ```json
     [
       {
         "product_name": "AH ELSTAR",
         "category": "FRUIT"
       },
       {
         "product_name": "AH NAAN",
         "category": "BREAD"
       }
     ]
     ```

Make sure to double-check for edge cases and prefer **OTHER** when in doubt.
